## The purpose of the project:
Building a system that builds a weighted and directed graph.

In this project I learned to build a directed and weighted graph in the JS programming language, 
I learned to make the differences in writing the functions and algorithms between the different languages.

- This project contains the algorithms - to find the shortest route. <br>
  dijekstra- uses to find the shortest path in a directed weighted graph.
